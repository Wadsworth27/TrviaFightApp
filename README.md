This app is the backbone for a game that seeks to combine a traditional trivia games with RPG elements. 
This was compelted as part of the session 1 CodeKentucky C# class and is my first dive into C#.
This app includes the following project elements: 
        Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
        Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
        Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
        Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
        Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
        Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file

What is contained here is just a backbone for what i hope this project to become. It has 
multiple game modes, a working shop, working fight mechanics, a weapon system, items, and temparay stat modification.
What hasn't been implemented is the ability to save a game, or gameplay beyond the first few levels. 
The reason for this is that I hope to convert this into a Blazor app in part 2 of the Code Kentucky course and am trying to limit what I will need to refactor.
